    "The randomization module implements algorithms to perturb existing graphs. This is commonly used to obtain a null-model for hypothesis testing in network analysis (see below for an example). Intuitively one tests whether an observation in original also appears in *similar* graphs. By doing so one can quantify the statistical significance of the observation. The ensemble of *similar* networks is commonly chosen as the set of (simple) graphs that have the same degree sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Curveball algorithms creates a random sample with the same degree sequence, by repeatedly selecting two random nodes and randomly exchanging their neighbourhoods (this is referred to as a trade). This corresponds to a random walk on the space of all graphs in the ensemble. The more trades are carried out, the less correlated input and output are. While there a no practical lower bounds, one typically choose 10 to 100 times the number n of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "GlobalCurveball is a related algorithm that is typically faster than Curveball. Also it's implementation is more versatile (e.g., it support directed and undirected graphs). In each step it carries out n/2 trades involving all nodes. A typical choice of the number of GlobalTrades is 10 to 100. **We recommend the usage of GlobalCurveball over Curveball for performance reasons**."

The algorithm perturbs an input graph, by iteratively randomizing the neighbourhoods of node pairs.

To accelerate the perturbation process we recommend to set degreePreservingShufflePreprocessing to true. This jump-starts the randomization process and yields faster convergence of the algorithm (see \"Smaller Universes for Uniform Sampling of 0,1-matrices with fixed row and column sums\" * by Annabell Berger, Corrie Jacobien Carstens [https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02624]).\n",
